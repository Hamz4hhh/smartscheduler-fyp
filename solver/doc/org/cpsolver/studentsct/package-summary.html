<div class="block"><h1>
         Student Sectioning Solver.
 </h1>
 <br>
 <br>
 Student sectioning is often considered as a subproblem of course
 timetabling. Once a timetable has been developed, the object is to
 assign students to classes (i.e., individual sections of a course) in
 order to minimize conflicts while respecting individual student course
 requests and preferences along with various other constraints.
 <br>
 <br>
 Before and during the construction of the timetable course demands are
 collected from students. During this preregistration process, each
 student can indicate the list of requested courses together with his
 or her preferences. These preferences contain course priorities (order
 of courses based on their importance for the student), alternative
 course requests (each course request can have one or more alternative
 courses), free time requests, wait-list preferences (if a student
 cannot be enrolled into the course, e.g., because of the space
 available, should he or she be assigned to the appropriate wait-list
 for the course), and additional schedule distribution preferences.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2>
         Initial Sectioning
 </h2>
 During the construction of the course timetable, course demands of
 already pre-registered students are considered. Since many students
 are anticipated to register later in the process, projected course
 demands are considered as well. These are deducted from the last-like
 semester enrollments, e.g., Fall 2006 course enrollments are used to
 predict Fall 2007 course demands. Minimization of potential student
 conflicts is one of the optimization criteria of the timetabling
 solver. Two classes are conflicting, i.e., they cannot be attended by
 the same students, if they are overlapping in time or if they are
 back-to-back (the second class starts just after the first ends) being
 placed in rooms that are too far apart.
 <br>
 Before the course timetabling solver is started, an initial sectioning
 of students into classes is processed. This sectioning is based on
 Carters (Carter 2001) homogeneous sectioning and is intended to
 minimize future student conflicts. However, it is still possible to
 improve on the number of student conflicts in the solution. This is
 accomplished by moving students between alternative classes of the
 same course during or after the search for a timetabling solution.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2>
         Batch Sectioning
 </h2>
 After the course timetable for the whole university is constructed,
 batch student sectioning process is executed. In this process, all
 pre-registered students are assigned to specific sections (classes) of
 courses in order to minimize conflicts as well as optimize preferences
 provided by students. Additional constraints deducted from the course
 structure as well as various reservations, that can be put on courses
 or particular classes, are respected. Students that were not able to
 get a requested course (or any of the provided alternatives) are
 enrolled to the appropriate waitlists.
 <br>
 The batch student sectioning is also using the projected student
 demands to compute the expected number of students in each class for
 the following online phase, however, pre-registered students take
 precedence before projected student demands. This means that a
 pre-registered student cannot be bumped out a requested course because
 of a projected student, but he or she may end up with a class which
 does not prevent projected students to take the course as well. Based
 on the computed solution, pre-registered students are assigned to
 classes and wait-lists and the projected students demands are used to
 identify space in each section that is to be reserved for students
 that are not yet registered. This information is then used in the
 online sectioning phase in order to direct already registered students
 from sections that are expected to be taken by the future students.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2>
         Online Sectioning
 </h2>
 After the first student schedule is created, till the begining of the
 semester, students can make changes in their schedules using the
 online interface. During this phase, existing students are allowed to
 remove themself from the requested courses or request additional
 courses and a new sectioning solution is provided to them in realtime.
 They can also change their class enrollments if there are other
 classes of the course that are available or wait-list themselves on
 classes that are not available. Wait-lists are automatically processed
 as the space frees on courses and classes. Some changes in the course
 timetable might occur as well, potentiality causing some re-sectioning
 of existing students. New students are using the same interface as
 existing students. They start with the course demands first, based on
 which they are sectioned to courses in real-time, and then they can
 continue as existing students.
 <br>
 As students submit schedule requests, each course is ranked in
 priority order. During realtime sectioning of a student, the search
 employs a backtracking process considering possible assignments
 beginning with those classes associated with the students highest
 priority course. As it evaluates each possible assignment, it compares
 available space with the space expected to be taken by the future
 students for each class. This difference between available space and
 the expected need for each class is used to direct students away from
 class assignments that would result in excess demand, however, in no
 case is an eligible student blocked from scheduling a course offering
 as a result of expected future demand. As students are assigned to
 specific classes during the sectioning process, the expected demand
 for each class is adjusted to reflect the assignment.</div>
