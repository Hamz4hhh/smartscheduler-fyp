         Problem Description
 </h2>
 Purdue is a large (39,000 students) public university with a broad
 spectrum of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In a
 typical term there are 9,000 classes offered using 570 teaching
 spaces. Approximately 259,000 individual student class requests must
 be satisfied. The complete university timetabling problem is
 decomposed into a series of subproblems to be solved at the academic
 department level, where the resources required to provide instruction
 are controlled. Several other special problems, where shared resources
 or student interactions are of critical importance, are solved
 institution wide. A major consideration in designing the system has
 been supporting distributed construction of departmental timetables
 while providing central coordination of the overall problem. This
 reflects the distributed management of instructional resources across
 multiple departments at the University.
 <br>
 <br>
 Purdue University timetabling problem is naturally decomposed into
 <ul>
         <li>
                 a centrally timetabled large lecture room problem (about 800 classes
                 being timetabled into 55 rooms with sizes up to 474 seats),
                 <li>
                         individually timetabled departmental problems (about 70 problems
                         with 10 to 500 classes),
                         <li>
                                 and a centrally timetabled computer laboratory problem (about 450
                                 classes timetabled into 36 rooms with 20 to 45 seats).
 </ul>
 The large lecture room problem consists of the largest classes on
 campus that are attended by students from multiple departments. The
 problem is also very dense. For instance, rooms are utilized on
 average over 70% of the available time, and this rate increases with
 room size (utilization is over 85% for all rooms above 100 seats and
 about 97% for the four largest rooms having over 400 seats). Since
 there are many interactions between this problem and the departmental
 problems, the large lecture problem is solved first and the
 departmental problems are solved on top of this solution.
 <br>
 <br>
 On the opposite end of the spectrum, the computer laboratory problem
 is solved at the very end of the process, on top of the large lecture
 room and departmental problem solutions. It contains only small
 classes, most of which have many sections (laboratories are normally
 the smallest subparts of a course). A typical example is a course
 having one large lecture class for 100 students, two departmental
 recitations with 50 students each, and four computer laboratories of
 25 students.
 <br>
 <br>
 The departmental problems are solved more or less concurrently. These
 problems are usually quite independent of one another, occurring in
 mostly different sets of rooms, with separate instructors and
 students. However, there are some cases with higher levels of
 interactions, particularly among students. In order to address these
 situations, a concept referred to as "committing" solutions has been
 introduced. Each user of the timetabling system (e.g., a departmental
 schedule manager) can create and store multiple solutions. At the end
 of the process a single solution must be selected and committed.
 During the commit, all conflicts between the current solution and all
 other solutions that have already been committed are checked and the
 commit is successful only when there are no hard conflicts between
 these solutions. Each problem being solved also automatically
 considers all of the previously committed solutions. This means that a
 room, an instructor, or a student is available at a particular time
 only if that time is not already occupied in a commited solution for a
 different problem. This approach can be beneficial, for instance, in a
 case where there are two or more departments with many common
 students. Here, the problems can be solved in an agreed upon order
 (the second department will solve its problem after the first
 department commits its solution). Moreover, if a room must be shared
 by two departments, a room sharing matrix can be defined, stating the
 times during the week that a room is available for each department to
 use. Finally, there is also an option to combine two or more
 individual problems and solve as one larger problem, considering all
 of the relations between the problems in real time.

 <br>
 <br>
 <h2>
         Model
 </h2>
 To minimize potential time conflicts, Purdue has historically
 subscribed to a set of standard meeting patterns. With few exceptions,
 1 hour x 3 day per week classes meet on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
 at the half hour (7:30, 8:30, 9:30, ...). 1.5 hour x 2 day per week
 classes meet on Tuesday and Thursday during set time blocks. 2 or 3
 hours x 1day per week classes must also fit within specific blocks,
 etc. Generally, all meetings of a class should be taught in the same
 location. Such meeting patterns are of interest to the problem
 solution as they allow easier changes between classes having the same
 or similar meeting patterns.
 <br>
 <br>
 Due to the set of standardized time patterns and administrative rules
 enforced at the university, it is generally possible to represent all
 meetings of a class by a single variable. This tying together of
 meetings considerably simplifies the problem constraints. Most classes
 have all meetings taught in the same room, by the same instructor, at
 the same time of day. Only the day of week differs. Moreover, these
 days and times are mapped together with the help of meeting patterns,
 e.g., a 2 hours x 3 day per week class can be taught only on Monday,
 Wednesday, Friday, beginning at 5 possible times. Or, for instance, a
 1 hour x 2 day per week class can be taught only on Monday-Wednesday,
 Wednesday-Friday or Monday-Friday, beginning at 10 possible times.
 <br>
 <br>
 In addition, all valid placements of a course in the timetable have a
 one-to-one mapping with values in the variable's domain. This domain
 can be seen as a subset of the Cartesian product of the possible
 starting times, rooms, etc. for a class represented by these values.
 Therefore, each value encodes the selected time pattern (some
 alternatives may occur, e.g., 1.5 hour x 2 day per week may be an
 alternative to 1 hour x 3 day per week), selected days (e.g., a two
 meeting course can be taught in Monday-Wednesday, Tuesday-Thursday,
 Wednesday-Friday), and possible starting times. A value also encodes
 the instructor and selected meeting room. Each such placement also
 encodes its preferences (soft constraints), combined from the
 preference for time, room, building and the room's available
 equipment. Only placements with valid times and rooms are present in a
 class's domain. For example, when a computer (classroom equipment) is
 required, only placements in a room containing a computer are present.
 Also, only rooms large enough to accommodate all the enrolled students
 can be present in valid class placements. Similarly, if a time slice
 is prohibited, no placement containing this time slice is in the
 class's domain.
 <br>
 <br>
 As mentioned above, each value, besides encoding a class's placement
 (time, room, instructor), also contains information about the
 preference for the given time and room. Room preference is a
 combination of preferences on the choice of building, room, and
 classroom equipment. The second group of soft constraints is formed by
 student requirements. Each student can enrol in several classes, so
 the aim is to minimize the total number of student conflicts among
 these classes. Such conflicts occur if the student cannot attend two
 classes to which he or she has enrolled because these classes have
 overlapping times. Finally, there are some group constraints
 (additional relations between two or more classes). These may either
 be hard (required or prohibited), or soft (preferred), similar to the
 time and room preferences (from -2 to 2).
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2>
         Constraints
 </h2>
 There are two types of basic hard constraints: resource constraints
 (expressing that only one course can be taught by an instructor or in
 a particular room at the same time), and group constraints (expressing
 relations between several classes, e.g., that two sections of the same
 lecture can not be taught at the same time, or that some classes have
 to be taught one immediately after another).
 <br>
 <br>
 Except the constraints described above, there are several additional
 constraints which came up during our work on this lecture timetabling
 problem. These constraints were defined in order to make the
 automatically computed timetable solution acceptable for users from
 Purdue University.
 <br>
 <br>
 First of all, if there are two classes placed one after another so
 that there is no time slot in between (also called back-to-back
 classes), distances between buildings need to be considered. The
 general feeling is that different rooms in the same building are
 always reasonable, moving to the building next door is to be
 discouraged, a couple of buildings away strongly discouraged, and any
 longer distance prohibited.
 <br>
 <br>
 Each building has its location defined as a pair of coordinates [x,y].
 The distance between two buildings is estimated by Euclides distance
 in such two dimensional space, i.e., (dx^2 + dy^2)^(1/2) where dx and
 dy are differences between x and y coordinates of the buildings. As
 for instructors, two subsequent classes (where there is no empty slot
 in between, called also back-to-back classes) are infeasible to teach
 when such difference is more than 200 meters (hard constraint). The
 other options (soft constraints) are:
 <ul>
         <li>
                 if the distance is zero (same building), then no penalty,
                 <li>
                         if the distance is above zero, but not more than 50 meters, then
                         the placement is discouraged,
                         <li>
                                 if the distance is between 50 and 200 meters, the placement is
                                 strongly discouraged
 </ul>
 <br>
 Our concern for distance between back-to-back classes for students is
 different. Here it is simply a question of whether it is feasible for
 students to get from one class to another during the 10-minute passing
 period. At present, the distance between buildings not more than 670
 meters is considered as an acceptable travel distance. For the
 distance above 670 meters, the classes are considered as too far. If
 there is a student attending both classes, it means a student conflict
 (same as when these classes are overlapping in time). The only
 exeption is when the first meeting is 90 minutes long -- the
 acceptable travel distance is 1000 meters, since there is for
 15-minute passing period.
 <br>
 <br>
 Next, since the automatic solver tries to maximize the overall
 accomplishment of soft time and room constraints (preferences), the
 resultant timetable might be unacceptable for some departments. The
 problem is that some departments define their time and room
 preferences more strictly than others. The departments which have not
 defined time and room preferences usually have most of their classes
 taught in early morning or late evening hours. Therefore, we
 introduced the departmental time and room preferences balancing
 mechanism. The solver is trying to fulfill the time and room
 preferences as well as to balance the used times between individual
 departments. This means that each department should use each time unit
 (half-hour, e.g., Monday 7:30 - 8:00) in a similar portion to the
 other time units used by the department.
 <br>
 <br>
 Finally, since all of the classes are at least 60 minutes long, every
 window of empty time slots of a room that is surrounded by classes on
 both sides and that is less than 60 minutes long (i.e., the room is
 not used for 30 minutes between two consecutive classes) is considered
 useless if no other class can use it. The number of such useless hours
 should be minimized. Also the situation when a room is occupied by a
 class which is using less than 2/3 of its seats is discouraged. Both
 these soft constraints are considered much less important than all the
 constraints described above.
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2>
         Student Sectioning
 </h2>
 Many course offerings consist of multiple classes, with students
 enrolled in the course divided among them. These classes are often
 linked by a set of constraints, namely:
 <ul>
         <li>
                 Each class has a limit stating the maximum number of students who
                 can be enrolled in it.
                 <li>
                         A student must be enrolled in exactly one class for each subpart of
                         a course.
                         <li>
                                 If two subparts of a course have a parent-child relationship, a
                                 student enrolled in the parent class must also be enrolled in one
                                 of the child classes.
 </ul>
 <br>
 Moreover, some of the classes of an offering may be required or
 prohibited for certain students, based on reservations that can be set
 on an offering, a configuration, or a class.
 <br>
 <br>
 Before implementing the solver, an initial sectioning of students into
 classes is processed. This sectioning is based on Carter's homogeneous
 sectioning and is intended to minimize future student conflicts.
 However, it is still possible to improve on the number of student
 conflicts in the solution. This can be accomplished by moving students
 between alternative classes of the same course during or after the
 search.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the current implementation, students are not re-sectioned during
 the search, but a student re-sectioning algorithm is called after the
 solver is finished or upon the user's request.
 <br>
 <br>
 Since students are not re-sectioned during the timetabling search, the
 computed number of student conflicts is really an upper bound on the
 actual number that may exist afterward. To compensate for this during
 the search, student conflicts between subparts with multiple classes
 are weighted lower than conflicts between classes that meet at a
 single time (i.e., having student conflicts that cannot be avoided by
 re-sectioning).</div>
