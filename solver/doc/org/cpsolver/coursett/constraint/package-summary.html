<h2 title="Package org.cpsolver.coursett.constraint Description">Package org.cpsolver.coursett.constraint Description</h2>
<div class="block">University Course Timetabling: Constraints.
 <br>
 <br>
 There are two types of basic hard constraints: resource constraints
 (expressing that only one course can be taught by an instructor or in
 a particular room at the same time), and group constraints (expressing
 relations between several classes, e.g., that two sections of the same
 lecture can not be taught at the same time, or that some classes have
 to be taught one immediately after another).
 <br>
 <br>
 Except the constraints described above, there are several additional
 constraints which came up during our work on this lecture timetabling
 problem. These constraints were defined in order to make the
 automatically computed timetable solution acceptable for users from
 Purdue University.
 <br>
 <br>
 First of all, if there are two classes placed one after another so
 that there is no time slot in between (also called back-to-back
 classes), distances between buildings need to be considered. The
 general feeling is that different rooms in the same building are
 always reasonable, moving to the building next door is to be
 discouraged, a couple of buildings away strongly discouraged, and any
 longer distance prohibited.
 <br>
 <br>
 Each building has its location defined as a pair of coordinates [x,y].
 The distance between two buildings is estimated by Euclides distance
 in such two dimensional space, i.e., (dx^2 + dy^2)^(1/2) where dx and
 dy are differences between x and y coordinates of the buildings. As
 for instructors, two subsequent classes (where there is no empty slot
 in between, called also back-to-back classes) are infeasible to teach
 when such difference is more than 200 meters (hard constraint). The
 other options (soft constraints) are:
 <ul>
         <li>
                 if the distance is zero (same building), then no penalty,
                 <li>
                         if the distance is above zero, but not more than 50 meters, then
                         the placement is discouraged,
                         <li>
                                 if the distance is between 50 and 200 meters, the placement is
                                 strongly discouraged
 </ul>
 <br>
 Our concern for distance between back-to-back classes for students is
 different. Here it is simply a question of whether it is feasible for
 students to get from one class to another during the 10-minute passing
 period. At present, the distance between buildings not more than 670
 meters is considered as an acceptable travel distance. For the
 distance above 670 meters, the classes are considered as too far. If
 there is a student attending both classes, it means a student conflict
 (same as when these classes are overlapping in time).
 <br>
 <br>
 Next, since the automatic solver tries to maximize the overall
 accomplishment of soft time and room constraints (preferences), the
 resultant timetable might be unacceptable for some departments. The
 problem is that some departments define their time and room
 preferences more strictly than others. The departments which have not
 defined time and room preferences usually have most of their classes
 taught in early morning or late evening hours. Therefore, we
 introduced the departmental time and room preferences balancing
 mechanism. The solver is trying to fulfill the time and room
 preferences as well as to balance the used times between individual
 departments. This means that each department should use each time unit
 (half-hour, e.g., Monday 7:30 - 8:00) in a similar portion to the
 other time units used by the department.
 <br>
 <br>
 At first, for each department and time unit, there is a number stating
 how many times each time unit can be used (i.e., how many placements
 of all classes from the department can be placed over the time unit).
 For instance, if there are two 1 hour x 2 days per week classes, the
 time unit Wednesday 8:00 - 8:30 can be used four times, i.e., each of
 these classes can be placed either on Monday-Wednesday or
 Wednesday-Friday from 8:00 till 9:00. Than, an average fill factor is
 computed for each department and time unit. It is a ratio between the
 computed number of placements using the time unit and the total number
 of placements of all classes from the department (it is sixty for the
 above example with two classes, each class can be placed in thirty
 different times if all possible times are allowed). So, this factor
 states the overall usage of a time unit for a department. The reason
 for computing such number is the fact that some times are used much
 more than others (e.g., if the department has most of the classes in n
 hours hour x 3 days per week, Tuesday and Thursday are used much less
 than Monday, Wednesday and Friday). The initial allowance, which
 states how many times each time unit can be used by a department is
 computed from this maximal fill factor: it is increased by the given
 percentage (20% is used in our tests) and rounded upwards to the first
 integer number. The overall department balancing penalty of a solution
 is the sum of overruns of this initial allowance over all time units
 and departments. The intention is to keep this number as low as
 possible.
 <br>
 <br>
 Finally, since all of the classes are at least two time slots long (60
 minutes), an empty time slot of a room which is surrounded by classes
 on both sides (i.e., the room is not used for 30 minutes between two
 consecutive classes) is considered useless if no other class can use
 it. The number of such useless half-hours should be minimized. Also
 the situation when a room is occupied by a class which is using less
 than 2/3 of its seats is discouraged. Both these soft constraints are
 considered much less important than all the constraints described
 above.</div>
